Though I no longer live there, I still subscribe to the Buffalo News and get a digital copy of the paper in my inbox. Every day as part of my morning routine, I take a look at the top stories in my hometown. Iâ€™ve been a subscriber for a while and noticed a pattern of sorts: no matter what time of year, the Bills are a front page mainstay. Starting January 1, 2020, I thought it might be a hoot to track how often the Bills were on the front page of the Buffalo News, and what that coverage looked like. Because the Bills were always there!

Well, not always. Not even half the time: of the 366 front pages of 2020, the Bills were on 179 for a shockingly low 48.9%. Of course, the Bills being suddenly good at football was not the only thing that happened in 2020. There is also an ongoing global pandemic.
