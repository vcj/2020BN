Though I no longer live there, I still subscribe to the Buffalo News and get a digital copy of the paper in my inbox. Every day as part of my morning routine, I take a look at the top stories in my hometown. I’ve been a subscriber for a while and noticed a pattern of sorts: no matter what time of year, the Bills are a front page mainstay. Starting January 1, 2020, I thought it might be a hoot to track how often the Bills were on the front page of the Buffalo News, and what that coverage looked like. Because the Bills were always there!

<br>
Well, not always. Not even half the time: of the 366 front pages of 2020, the Bills were on 179 for a shockingly low 48.9%. And there was a huge lull in April and May. Of course, the Bills being suddenly good at football was not the only thing that happened in 2020. There is also an ongoing global pandemic.

Tracking coverage of these two stories shows a fascinating (to me, an easily impressed dipshit) progression of how quickly the virus consumed our lives, from a few stock market related articles to, just a few weeks later total command of page A1 for months. It barely let up for the rest of the year. I don’t expect it to let up for a long time. 

What counts as a story? This was subjective. A story about former Bill Ryan Fitzpatrick still being appreciated by Bills fans? Yes, that counts. A story about how the Goo Goo Dolls are dealing with the pandemic? That did not. Those two stories were actually on the same day, September 20th. The day after that makes a slightly better example, though.

What I did was just trace the block of space where each story was placed, red for Bills and blue for COVID-19, and make a note in a table as to what was covered that day. I then layered the blocks, at 10% opacity and grouped by month, to give a sense of what a month in Buffalo News coverage of the Bills and the virus looked like for those 29-31 days. I also kept a timeline, just a simple binary yes-no as to whether the topic was present.

Before the big chart, couple notes. First, the bar at the top is apparently called a ‘teaser.’ It consists just of a small photo, headline, and sometimes a subhead. It's where many of the Bills stories were over the year. Even though it's not really a full story I did count it because I was looking at the whole page and also at the top it's quite eye-catching. It was also eliminated almost entirely for the months of April and May, presumably to make more room for pandemic news. Second, you will note on the timeline that specific events are usually highlighted the day after they happened. That's because that's when they'd be printed in the paper. Seems obvious, but it threw me the first time.

Okay here's the big chart. If you click it'll open in a new tab
